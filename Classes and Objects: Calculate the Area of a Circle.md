# EXP-4 Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

##  Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

##  Program
~~~
import math class 
cse():
def mech(Self,num):
a=math.pi*num*num print(f"Area
of circle: {a:.2f}")
r=int(input()) 
obj=cse() 
obj.mech(r)
~~~

## Output
![439181933-6a2b0c1c-fbda-4f6c-981d-66b1825517c1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6636b6f4-0e18-41cf-a4dc-d76c98cd77c4)

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed
